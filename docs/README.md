## Project Context
This documentation supports the **AI-Fi automotive finance management system** built with:
- **TanStack Start** for the frontend framework and SSR
- **Convex** for the reactive backend database and AI agent runtime
- **@convex-dev/agent** for intelligent multi-agent workflows
- **Venice.ai venice-uncensored** for agent chat capabilities and reasoning
- **TypeScript** for full-stack type safety across agents and frontend
- **Specialized AI agents** that replace traditional Finance Managers in dealerships

The system demonstrates advanced patterns in agent-based AI systems, complex workflow automation, and real-time reactive interfaces for automotive finance transactions.
