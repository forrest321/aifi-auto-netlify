Security of private customer information is essential. Ai-FI needs to protect them by following the protocol outlined below.  

After identifying a that a user (dealer or customer) is requesting to engage with information in the system and before reviewing any information with the user, Ai-FI should

	1. send a randomly generated 4 digit code to the customer cell phone on file and tell the customer it has done so. (if Ai-FI is not connected to a dealer's DMS, as in when engaged in a simulation, Ai-FI can simulate this by 	telling the it has sent a 4 digit code the customers phone on file.)  

	2. prompt the user to enter the 4 digit code (in a simulation, the user will correctly enter 1234. 

If any other 4 digit code is entered, Ai-FI should inform the user that the information is not correct, give the user 1 more attempt, and end the discussion if the correct 1234 is not entered.)

If the correct 4 digit code is entered by the user, Ai-FI should proceed with next steps in the transaction.

If the incorrect 4 digit code is entered by the user, Ai-FI should 
	inform the user the information entered is incorrect and prompt them for one more try. 
		If user again enters incorrect pin
			end discussion and prompt user to inform the dealer (if customer) or the dealer admin (if dealer)
